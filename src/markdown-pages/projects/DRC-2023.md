### Overview

Our undertaking of the <a href="https://qutrobotics.com/droid-racing-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Droid Racing Competition</span></a>, aimed at top performing robotics and mechatronics universities from across Australia, was certainly an ambitious experience. While we didn't have the best start due to limitations imposed by regular high school coursework, exams, and assignments alike, all members pushed through and we came out the other side being the youngest ever team competing in DRC, finishing an honourable 7th out of 15 national Australian Universities. We are eyeing the top five for next year, and are already working on improved robot specs for 2023!
