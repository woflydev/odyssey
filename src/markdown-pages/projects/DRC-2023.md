### Overview

After our first experience competing at a national level at the <a href="https://qutrobotics.com/droid-racing-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Droid Racing Competition 2022</span></a>, 
we decided to go back to the drawing board and redesign all the electronics, hardware, and software piplines from scratch. We also upgraded our wheels, allowing for higher top speeds and eliminating the need for reliance on an Arduino board! Watch this space, because we're about to make DRC history.

### The Challenge

As with previous DRC challenges, the main goal is to navigate a fully autonomous car around a taped track using nothing but computer vision.

Some of the technologies that we are using to develop the vehicle are:
<ul>
<li>-Fast ONNX neural networks, simultaneously trained using the Unity Engine's ML-Agent API.</li>
<li>-Custom PCBs to ensure electrical safety and efficiency.</li>
<li>-Simulated 3D environments with real-world driven data to ensure our robot doesn't break!</li>
<li>-Unity's new and emerging Data-Oriented Technology Stack to allow for subscene loading and entity component system integration.</li>
<li>-Redesigned body and power supply to ensure redundancies and mitigate timeloss due to hardware error.</li>
</ul>
