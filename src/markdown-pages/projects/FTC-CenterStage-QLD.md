### Overview

After completing the 2023 season of the Droid Racing Challenge, our team's focus shifted toward the *FIRST* Tech Challenge, a robotics competition aimed at high school students. We are currently in the process of designing and building a robot to compete in the 2023-2024 season of the FTC, with the goal of qualifying for the World Championships in Houston, Texas.

Watch this space, because we'll be posting all of our progress updates here!

### Results

We became the very first team in our school's history to attain Winning Alliance Captain (WAC) after coming 3rd in the Queensland State Championships. Thank you so much to our alliance partners [Robokings Onyx (15145)](https://www.instagram.com/robokings_onyx/) and [Vaporwave (21511)](https://www.instagram.com/vaporwave.21511/) for helping us achieve this milestone!

The entire team is looking forward to Sydney, as we prepare to go up against Australia's best teams at the National Championships.
