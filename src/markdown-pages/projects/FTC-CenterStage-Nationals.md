### Overview

After advancing from the Queensland State Championships with Winning Alliance Captain under our belts, we're gearing up for Sydney! We're not too sure what to expect, but we're excited to see what the other teams have in store. Plus, we're looking forward to meeting some of the other teams from around Australia in person!
