### Overview

Our undertaking of the <a href="https://qutrobotics.com/droid-racing-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Droid Racing Competition</span></a>, aimed at top performing robotics and mechatronics universities from across Australia, was certainly an ambitious experience. While we didn't have the best start due to limitations imposed by regular high school coursework, exams, and assignments alike, all members pushed through and we came out the other side being the youngest ever team competing in DRC, finishing an honourable 7th out of 15 national Australian Universities. We are eyeing the top five for next year, and are already working on improved robot specs for 2023!

### The Challenge

The main goal of the Droid Racing Challenge is to complete a marked course using only computer vision as quickly as possible. With schoolwork and teachers breathing down our backs, getting all the parts and labour required to construct and code the final product did not go as smoothly as we had hoped. Our programmers began coding for the competition 5 days before the actual thing!
