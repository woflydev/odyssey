### Overview

After completing the 2023 season of the Droid Racing Challenge, our team's focus shifted toward the *FIRST* Tech Challenge, a robotics competition aimed at high school students. We are currently in the process of designing and building a robot to compete in the 2023-2024 season of the FTC, with the goal of qualifying for the World Championships in Houston, Texas.

Watch this space, because we'll be posting all of our progress updates here!
